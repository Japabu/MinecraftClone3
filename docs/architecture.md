# Core architecture: one client path, two server transports

Singleplayer and multiplayer share **one** client code path. Singleplayer runs the server in-process and
talks to it over an in-memory loopback connection; multiplayer swaps the loopback for a TCP socket.

```

- **`WorldServer`** (`Blocks/WorldServer.cs`): the authority. Block storage, terrain gen, RGB block-light +
  sky-light propagation, save/load, entity simulation. **No meshing, no GL** — runs fully headless.
- **`WorldClient`** (`Client/Blocks/WorldClient.cs`): the client replica. Holds chunks streamed from the
  server, **caches them and owns their eviction** (drops a chunk past `CacheDistance`, then sends a
  `ChunkRelease`), meshes them, renders them, holds remote entities. **No terrain gen, no disk, no lighting.**
- **`ServerNetwork`** (`Networking/ServerNetwork.cs`): per-client sessions, interest-based chunk streaming,
  dirty-chunk resends, entity relay, the TCP listener.
- **Authority:** server owns blocks + light (block + sky). Position is **client-authoritative** — there is no
  server-side physics; the client runs walk gravity/collision and writes the result, the server relays it.
  The client *requests* edits; the server applies and broadcasts the result.
- **Join handshake (loading screen).** Login → server assigns id + a seed-derived spawn (`LoginAccept`) and
  starts streaming chunks around it → once the spawn column is *sent* it sends **`PlayerReady`** → the client
  (`StateWorld._loading`) shows a loading screen and enters the world once `PlayerReady` arrives **and** the
  spawn chunks have decoded locally (ground before gravity). One packet path, so SP (loopback) and MP (TCP)
  share the exact same flow; a wall-clock timeout only fail-safes a dropped signal.
- **Chunk lifetime is client-owned (see [networking.md](networking.md)).** The server streams a chunk once and
  keeps it in the session's `SentChunks` until the chunk is dirtied or the **client** releases it; the server
  never tells a client to unload. Walk away and back and the client re-renders from its own cache — zero bytes
  on the wire.
